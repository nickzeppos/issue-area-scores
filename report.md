## Policy Areas and Legislative Subjects

CG (Congress.gov) uses two types of codes: [policy areas](https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/policy-area) and [legislative
subjects](https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/legislative-subject-terms). Bills can have only
one policy area, but can have many legislative subjects.

Policy areas are coded "by legislative analysts in the Congressional Research Service upon the release of official text by
the Government Publishing Office." There is often a short delay between
publication of bill text and when a bill receives a policy area code from CRS. The policy area associated with a bill can
also change within a Congress, depending on changes it undergoes in the legislative process:

> "In some cases, the character of a measure may
> change drastically in the course of the legislative process (as when a bill is substantially amended and expanded after
> introduction). Where this occurs, the policy area may be adjusted to accurately reflect the new version's focus or
> content." <sup>[1]</sup>
