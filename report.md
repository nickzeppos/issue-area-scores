# Issue Area Scores: Congressional Bills --> Congress.gov

## Policy Areas and Legislative Subjects

CG (Congress.gov) uses two types of codes: [policy areas](https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/policy-area) and [legislative
subjects](https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/legislative-subject-terms). Bills can have only
one policy area, but can have many legislative subjects.

Policy areas are coded "by legislative analysts in the Congressional Research Service upon the release of official text by
the Government Publishing Office." There is often a short delay between
publication of bill text and when a bill receives a policy area code from CRS. The policy area associated with a bill can
also change within a Congress, depending on changes it undergoes in the legislative process:

> "In some cases, the character of a measure may
> change drastically in the course of the legislative process (as when a bill is substantially amended and expanded after
> introduction). Where this occurs, the policy area may be adjusted to accurately reflect the new version's focus or
> content." [congress.gov]

## Two Main Problems: Uncoded Bills and Deprecated Codes

### Uncoded Bills

Here's a count of the number of bills, per congress and chamber, that do not have a CG policy area. The problem is worse in earlier congresses.

### Deprecated Codes

Deprecated codes, like uncoded bills, are also more problematic the further we go back. Take the 93rd Congress, for instance.
A look at some of the codes in the 93rd will be instuctive:

In the 93rd alone there are **140 unique** policy areas. But this is a bit misleading-- unlike the uncoded problem,
which sort of drags into the more recent congresses (albeit less fiercely), the deprecated codes issue seems to basically
stop at the 96th. Here's a count of unique policy areas, by congress:

| Cong | uncodedCount |

| 113  | 33           |
| 114  | 33           |

Some of these categories easily collapse into one our two CAP major issue areas, some are less clear. Here are a few examples:
